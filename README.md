This project demonstrates a simple embedded systems application using Arduino to control the speed of a DC fan with two push buttons and an LED indicator.
One button increases the fan speed, the other decreases the fan speed, while the LED shows the system status.
This project was built as part of my embedded systems design learning.

Features

DC fan speed control using push buttons,
LED indication,
Simple and beginner-friendly Arduino code,
Demonstrates basic digital input and PWM output.

Components Used

Arduino board,
DC fan,
Two push buttons,
LED,
Resistors,
Connecting wires,
Power supply / battery.

What this project demonstrates;

Reading digital inputs from buttons,
Controlling output devices (fan and LED),
Using PWM to control motor speed,
Basic embedded system design workflow.
